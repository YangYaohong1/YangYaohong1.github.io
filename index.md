  Hi, I am a master student in the <a href="https://stat.nankai.edu.cn/">School of Statistics and Data Science</a> at <a href="https://www.nankai.edu.cn/">Nankai University</a>. I am supervised by Lei Wang. My research interest is distributed system, with a recent focus on Byzantine attacks. I am always amazed by the whole lifecycle of large-scale systems, their interactions with people, and the implication of their usage. In particular, I am exploring the following topics:
  - distributed data
  - federated data
  - Byzantine-robust
</p>

  I got my bachelor’s degree in Statistics at <a href="https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/">Northwestern Polytechnical University</a>. During my bachelor’s study, I exchanged at <a href="https://www.nsysu.edu.tw/">National Sun Yat-sen University</a> in Taiwan.
