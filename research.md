    description: Inspired by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael-Jordan-3/publication/303521286_Communication-efficient_distributed_statistical_learning/links/57d2689208ae5f03b48b61f8/Communication-efficient-distributed-statistical-learning.pdf">Michael Jordan and others' work about distributed statistical learning </a>, I started research on distributed learning. Jordan et al. replaced the global likelihood function by communication-efficient surrogate likelihood (CSL). However, they required that the loss functions are smooth and have at least second-order derivatives, which limits its scope of application. For example, in some studies about high expenses in insurance, researchers are interested in predicting quantiles with nonsmooth quantile loss functions. So we investigated a communication-efficient high-dimensional CQR estimation for distributed data.

    description: Our motivating example is the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+Multi-Site+Air-Quality+Data"> Beijing Air Quality data</a>. It contains hourly air pollutants data from 12 nationally controlled air-quality monitoring sites in Beijing from March 1, 2013 to February 28, 2017 and includes the

    description: Now, I am interested in federated learning with Byzantine attacks. Based on Decentralized Gradient Descent (DGD), Wu et al. proposed Network Gradient Desent (NGD), however, how can NGD be extended to situations with Byzantine attacks is under inverstigation.
